<h4>Background</h4>

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Ha Bui (I go by Lexie). I did my undergraduate and graduate studies at Ewha Womans University, South Korea both on full-ride scholarships where I majored in Economics with a concentration in Econometrics and Causal Inference to analyze policy intervention impacts using observational data in social science. 

I'm particularly interested in Experimentation in Tech Companiesâ€”how A/B testing, causal inference, and statistical analysis drive better product decisions. I enjoy learning about data science, machine learning, and experimentation frameworks to build insight-driven products. 

I'm currently exploring online experimentation, uplift modeling, and reinforcement learning for decision-making.
