## Lexie Bui - Projects Portfolio 

<h4>Index</h4>

This repository holds several personal projects that I've done throughout the years. 

1. [Demand Forecasting](https://github.com/lexie21/demandforecasting)

2. [Movie Recommender](https://github.com/lexie21/movierecommender)

3. [Loan Defaulter](https://github.com/lexie21/loandefaulter)

Each repo (mostly) covers a distinct problem in data science and should be accompanied by some form of documentation.
